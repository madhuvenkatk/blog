I am always fascinated with adventures trips, especially going around the world on cycling through wild forest, mountains and rivers. I came across this new book “Grit” in a local store during this lockdown.  An Indian cyclist shares his 400 days of cycling trip experience from Alaska to Argentina.

For anyone, who has a dream to travel and explore the world, I would recommend to read this book to get an idea on what it takes in planning for a such long trip.

It gives great insights about his experience in planning this long trip and its challenges. It mostly covers about his cycling experience in dense forest around Alaska and Canadian borders and his sleepless nights during camping in the night around the lake side's due to fear of Bears attack. The most interesting is, the author shares lot of tips on local food, local stores, restaurants from Alaska to Argentina. Few chapters were bit boring, it was very repetitive. We can skip few part of the book. Few chapters are quite interesting.
