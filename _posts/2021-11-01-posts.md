Many tech companies have been working remote for most of the year due to COVID, expecting to return to the office sometime in 2022.  I have recently learned that most of companies are considering hybrid model as a future work model. This announcement marked a mind shift for me, where I need to stop just surviving remote work, and start thriving in remote work. Not only for my own sake, but also for the teams I lead.

<h2>First steps</h2>
I have created a comfortable and ergonomic home office setup. I push myself everyday to get out of home, for both cycling, walking and socializing. I take short walks with my dog "Kio" three times a day, which helps me to clear my mind and refocus.
