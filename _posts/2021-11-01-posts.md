Many tech companies have been working remote for most of the year due to COVID, expecting to return to the office sometime in 2022.  I have recently learned that most of companies are considering hybrid model as a future work model. This announcement marked a mind shift for me, where I need to stop just surviving remote work, and start thriving in remote work. Not only for my own sake, but also for the teams I lead.

<h2>My Work from home setup and routine</h2>
I have created a comfortable and ergonomic home office setup. I push myself everyday to get out of home, for both cycling, walking and socializing. I take short walks with my dog "Kio" three times a day, which helps me to clear my mind and refocus.

<h2>Engaging with my team remotely</h2>

The key to building great remote relationships is intention. You need to try harder to find have meaningful meetings, and truly understand each person's perspective. We try to communciate asynchronously when possible. Like other remote teams, we primarily gather in Ringcentral chat room more often to communicate asynchronously to keep everyone up to date. We try to have weekly 1:1 meetings and monthly once All hands meeting.
