Many tech companies have been working remote for most of the year due to COVID, expecting to return to the office sometime in 2022.  I have recently learned that most of companies are considering hybrid model as a future work model. This announcement marked a mind shift for me, where I need to stop just surviving remote work, and start thriving in remote work. Not only for my own sake, but also for the teams I lead.

<h2>title: "First steps"</h2>
For anyone, who has a dream to travel and explore the world, I would recommend to read this book to get an idea on what it takes in planning for a such long trip.  
</div>
<br>
<div>
The author talks about his experience in planning this long trip and its challenges. It covers about his lonel cycling experience in dense forest around Alaska and Canadian borders and his sleepless nights during camping in the night around the lake side's due to fear of Bears attack. The most interesting is, the author also shares lot of tips on local food, local stores, restaurants from Alaska to Argentina, which was interesting to read. Few chapters were bit boring, it was very repetitive. We can skip few parts of the book. Few chapters are quite interesting.
<br>
Enjoy reading!
