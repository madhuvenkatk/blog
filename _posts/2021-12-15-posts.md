I’ve been asking myself “What opportunities can’t I see because they’re not having big titles enough?”

The very best opportunities for learning and growth rarely comes with big titles. In my experience, people who takes bets on exciting, but non-prestigious or no big titles in their career are more successful in the long run.

You can out-perform your peers by finding under priced projects that others don’t judge to be valuable.

Everybody wants to be high status. But despite the financial rewards, few people are willing to work on low-status projects, even they have the potential to become highly successful in the long run.
 
The world is filled with under-priced opportunities that are only to available to people who are comfortable with promising, but low status.
