<h2>Who i am</h2>
I was formerly Director at Firestream worldwide Inc, and scaled the India engineering team from 0 to 100 engineers, paving the way for its millions $ exit in 2017.  I joined PDI Software Inc. on acquisition as one of the first leadership teams in India in 2017 as Engineering Ops Head/ Site Lead  

Besides building offshore teams for over 15 years, I have given talks in various universities/forums in India on building and scaling engineering teams for product companies. I am passionate about building high-performance teams, which led to advising many startups as a consultant.
