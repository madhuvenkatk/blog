<h2>Who i am</h2>
I was formerly Director at Firestream worldwide Inc, and scaled the India engineering team from 0 to 65+ engineers, paving the way for its millions $ exit in 2017.  I joined PDI Software Inc., on acquisition as one of the first leadership team in India in 2017 as Engineering Ops Head/ Site Lead.  

Besides building offshore teams for over 15 years, I have given talks in various universities/forums in India on building and scaling engineering teams for product companies. I am passionate about building high-performance teams. 


<h2>What excites me</h2>

I'm particularly motivated in building anything from ground zero to something meaningful. The areas include, creating new products, new teams, new process and new startups.
